## S01 — How’s your reflex? Introduction to Fabric Data Activator
**Speaker:** Ásgeir Gunnarsson  
**Type:** Automation  

Have you heard about Data Activator? The new kid on the block in Microsoft Fabric. It’s a tool where you can monitor numbers and events, set thresholds, and react when those thresholds are broken.

In this session we will dive into Data Activator and its items Reflexes. We will explain what it is, and what it isn’t.

Then there is demo time.  
**Demo 1:** Monitoring values in Power BI reports & streaming data  
**Demo 2:** Setting up thresholds & checks in Reflex
